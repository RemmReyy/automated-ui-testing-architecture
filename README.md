- **Python** – programming language used for test implementation

## 📐 Design Patterns Used

- Page Object Model (POM)
- Singleton
- Factory
- Strategy
- Facade

## 🧪 Features

- Modular and scalable test structure
- Clear separation of test logic and test data
- Reusable components and helpers
- Configurable environment setup
